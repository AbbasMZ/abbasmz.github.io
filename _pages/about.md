I'm a PhD student and Teaching Assistant in [Computing Science](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html) at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html). I am also a Research Assistant at [Professor Herbert Yang's lab](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~yang/), specialized in Computer Vision and Computer Graphics.

Summary of Research Interests
======

My broad research interests include computer vision, machine learning, reinforcement learning, and solutions for complex problems as in computational biophysics. My current research projects span across image restoration as in deblurring and super-resolution, representation learning, neural architecture search, 3D reconstruction of transparent objects, particle picking in cryogenic electron microscopy, effects of experience replay in policy gradient methods, and the exploration-exploitation trade-off.
